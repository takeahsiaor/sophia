    <h4><em>Parental commitments (if applicable)</em></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>For students ages 4-6, parents are welcome to sit in the lesson during the first few weeks. After this time period it is recommended that the parent sit out so that your child can learn independently and start to build a relationship with the teacher.</li>
